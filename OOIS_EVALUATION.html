									<h2>My evaluation of the project in week 7</h2>
									<p>In Unit 7, I have been asked to design software for a supermarket, and I am very excited about this assignment as I can finally get a chance to be creative and design something on my own. The lectures have been covered a lot about the class diagram and the class relationship, and we can finally apply the theory to the real-life case of the supermarket.</p>
									<p>From this assignment, there is a detailed description of the goal of the design, which includes several objects and interactions in between. In the beginning, the description seems very complicated for me, and hard to decide where to start. I started by making a list of the classes, assigned these classes to the tables of my class diagram, and added attributes to each class. This is the most challenging step for me in this assignment because I was not able to see the bigger picture yet.</p>
									<p>After all the classes are decided, everything seems to make more sense. I started to link the relationships from one class to another. In this step, I drafted my design on a website tool named “Visual Paradigm Online” as it has the function to link the relationship between each class table, such as composition, association …etc. I found the class diagram helpful as it visualizes the class relationships, and allowed me to see what is missing from the design.</p>
									<p>Based on the draft of my class diagram, I manage to modify it several times to make it more logical. I also added the function to each class table whenever I added a relationship. After all the classes and the relationships are decided, I arranged the tables and the relationship lines to make them more readable from the diagram. I also added different colors to the class tables grouped by their properties to make the diagram more beautiful and logical.</p>
									<p>Software design is a long way process for me. Even I had a draft before I started, it still required me a lot of modifications to enhance the software all the time. For example, there was a “self-checkout machine” class in my first draft. Then I decided to remove it after I realized it is redundant. </p>
									<p>After I finished the Unit 11 assignment, I even noticed more mistakes I had made and realized more modifications can be applied. This assignment also makes me question more about day-to-day life as it makes me realize many simple topics can link to the class diagram concept. I start to think more whenever I visit a supermarket and wonder how the software can be enhanced. I am happy to have this assignment which gave me the chance to be creative and learn from my own mistake during the designing process.</p>

									<h2>My evaluation of the project in week 11</h2>
									<p>The assignment of System Implementation in Unit 11 is very challenging for me. I knew we have been studying the class diagram and learning python from the Codio, I didn’t expect this soon we will combine these two topics in a practical way. But then I realized we have been given all the materials to complete this puzzle. This is indeed the most interesting and efficient way to practice these topics.</p>
									<p>The project should be done from Jupyter, a tool that I can test my output piece by piece, which made my project smooth and enjoyable. I spent less time finding the error and bugs in my code, and I can have more time to enhance my code.</p>
									<p>I started my work by creating all the classes and assigning attributes to them. Then, I start to define functions for each class, so they can interact with each other. Then I created more variables for some classes so they can store values when the user calls some functions. My approach is to make everything very organized and clean from the beginning, as I can imagine the code will get more and more complicated while more functions are added.</p>									
									<p>Other than the code for the class, I also implemented the interface to make the testing process more user-friendly, and the interface will also be more close to the software in reality. Instead of typing the name or date to run the function, I implement some name buttons and calendars for the user to select from. The goal is to make the system more interesting and practical.</p>
									<p>In the process of developing the system, I found it challenging to create a function that will interact with multiple classes. It is also hard for me to design the Appointment Schedule class which will store multiple appointment entities. Although I have finished all the python exercises from Codio, I still did a lot of research from the internet to optimize my code while developing my code.</p>
									<p>It took me a full month to complete the system design. The first week I have finished creating all the classes. Then it took me two weeks to complete all the functions, I also modified a lot of my existing classes in detail during this process. And I spent another week adding all the documentaries to the code and organized my code line by line to make them prettier. I also implemented the interface during this stage.</p>
									<p>Although this is a tough project for me, I still enjoy the time that I have spent. And I will definitely optimize my code more to make it closer to perfect if I have more time. I really enjoy this project because I feel I am learning to build something real that can be used in real life one day.</p>
