									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>Object-Oriented Programming is a very interesting module that I enjoy. Compare to other modules, the Object-Oriented Programming module is more practical and requires more exercise and practice, which gave me more motivation for my study. The topic is also going deeper, and I need to spend more time to ensure I fully understand the concept and see the big picture. Overall I enjoy the learning materials and the design of the courses, which offer the knowledge in the appropriate order. It is possible to follow up each lecture and exercise to bring me to the next chapter of the learning journey.</p>
									
									<h3>Class Diagram</h3>
									<p>At the beginning of the module, we were studying the core concept of Object-Oriented design. It was hard for me at the beginning, as the course is theoretical and I never had real experience in this field. I even had a hard time telling the difference between “Composition” and “Aggregation”. The relationships between each class were also hard for me to understand, as the example provided in the lecture is limited. I can fully understand the sample class diagram from the course but might be challenging for me to design on my own from scratch.</p>
									<p>The extensive reading and other information from the internet helped me to overcome this difficulty. I found more class diagrams from the internet with different themes, and compare each of the diagrams to see their patterns. This method worked, and the core concept of the object-oriented design started to make sense for me.</p>
									
									<h3>Coding of Python</h3>
									<p>The python code in this module is more complicated than the previous module. I found it is quite difficult to follow up on the progress from Codio this time. I could understand every part of the Codio courses as they are quite straightforward, but sometimes the exercise at the end of the course is way too advanced compared to the introduction. Some solutions were not covered in the previous lectures, which cost me more time to find a solution.</p>
									<p>Even it was hard for me to complete the exercise sometimes, I am still happy with the knowledge I have gained in this module. I have learned how to customize the error message, how to build the private attribute for the class, and the best practice to add the functions and methods. The courses gave me more new ideas on how to enhance my code.</p>
									<p>Defining the function in Python was always my weakest part, but after all, I have learned from the module, I feel more confident in this field now. I also like the part when we need to combine what we have learned from the class diagram with the python code. It makes me understand the concept from both aspects and clears most of my doubts about the relationship arrangement between the classes.</p>
									
									<h3>Coding of SQL</h3>
									<p>Regarding the SQL courses from Codio, I think it is relatively easier than the Python courses. Probably because I have experience managing the database, I can relate to most of the concepts and didn’t find too much trouble on the topic. The only thing that I am not used to is the interface from the Codio. I am more used to the Microsoft SQL Server Management from my work, and from there, it is easier to type in the SQL command with the output showing as tables. But for me, it is also something I need to get used to. Therefore, I am happy to have this opportunity to operate MySQL during the module. And I find this module helpful to broaden my SQL knowledge from all the lessons and exercises.</p>
									
									<h3>Design and Build the Software</h3>
									<p>Designing and building the software are the most exciting parts of this module. I feel that all the knowledge we had learned is to prepare for this moment. I hope to be a full-time engineer is because of two things: first is to play with the codes and optimize them, and second is to build something creative. And the project from the module gave me this opportunity.</p>
									<p>The most struggling part of the project for me is to start. I always spent too much time planning how to start, and I tend to overthink the potential problem I might confront before they happen. And these are the things that slow me down at the beginning. From the project of this module, I learn not to exaggerate the obstacle, and to take action right away without hesitation. I learn that once the work is started, things will start to make more sense, and most of my previous concerns will be resolved easily. I also learn how to progress my work more efficiently without time wasted.</p>
									
									<h3>Personal Life</h3>
									<p>After finishing the courses of this module, I have improved my critical thinking skill. From my day-to-day life, I start to question the mechanism and logic behind the objects more often. When I go to the gym, I start to think about what their membership system might look like. When I am using some application from the mobile phone, I start to think is there any possible way to enhance this app. I think building a critical mindset is also a valuable lesson I have learned from my learning journey.</p>
									
									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>Object-Oriented Programming is a very interesting topic for me, and I enjoy the module a lot. What I have gained from the module is the experience on the practical project, critical thinking skills, and the skill to search for solutions from the internet. I learned not to stress out when I have too many bugs in my code, and I learned how to be a problem solver by using all the resources that I have.</p>
