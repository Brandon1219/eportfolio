									<h3>My evaluation</h3>
									<p>In Unit 11, we need to build up the application based on our design from the previous assignment with our proposed features. Although this was an exciting project that we can be creative and practical, it was indeed a complicated and time-consuming developing process.</p>
									<p>As we all realized the project would challenge, our team started the team meeting regarding this project quite early, and it allows us to have more time to make the full plan. Making a plan for this project was not easy, as there were many aspects to be concerned about. We needed to decide which resources to use, and how the data and actions should be linked before we can start a further discussion.</p>
									<p>I appreciated that Yvone set up the database in AWS and Yusuf set up the API functions from GCP, which provided the team an environment to initiate our development. Once the environment was set up, we could finally investigate the workload in detail. For instance, how to achieve each proposed feature, how the interface should look like, and what the expected behavior corresponds to each function. We realized the workload was huge, which required each member to spend a big amount of time developing each part.</p>
									<p>We were facing another problem, that some bugs occurred during development, which means more time was required to fix those issues while our workloads were already overloaded. Thanks to our teamwork, each member was willing to investigate each raised bug and solve them with their experience. Our project could never be completed in time without the support and collaboration of our amazing team.</p>
									<p>We developed our application based on the first assignment. However, we made some changes to simplify the application. The reason is to complete our project in time and focus on the core feature we agreed on for the application. The below screenshots show we simplify the workflow by removing the trust-based authentication.</p>
