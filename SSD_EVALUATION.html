									<h2 style="text-align:center">Project in Unit 6</h2>
									<h3>My evaluation</h3>
									<p>In this module we were asked to develop an application with a secure repository as a team, and in the assignment of Unit 6, we would need to submit our design document with all the specifications.</p>
									<p>There are a lot of requirements need to be covered into our design, and the design would be related to our second team project as well. Therefore, our team spent longer time at the beginning for planning to ensure the best quality of outcome can be achieved.</p>
									<p>It was stressful and frustrated at first, as no one led the project. The reason was because no one was confident enough to share their ideas. But then we overcame this problem very soon as we started to get familiar with our collaborative style, and get to know each other better. Once we built up our first version of the document layout, each team members became more proactive in providing ideas and sharing potential plan during the team meeting.</p>
									<p>After all the actions were listed, each team member was free to choose which tasks they would like to take based on their own specialty and experience. Some members are good with researching information from references, while some members are good with design the application structure. </p>
									<p>Our team has regular team meetings that allow us to share our progress and confirm the next action. The team meetings increase the quality of our team’s communication and accelerate the progress of our project. I really appreciated the time that all my teammates spent during the team session.</p>

									<h2 style="text-align:center">Project in Unit 11</h2>
									<h3>My evaluation</h3>
									<p>In Unit 11, we need to build up the application based on our design from the previous assignment with our proposed features. Although this was an exciting project that we can be creative and practical, it was indeed a complicated and time-consuming developing process.</p>
									<p>As we all realized the project would challenge, our team started the team meeting regarding this project quite early, and it allows us to have more time to make the full plan. Making a plan for this project was not easy, as there were many aspects to be concerned about. We needed to decide which resources to use, and how the data and actions should be linked before we can start a further discussion.</p>
									<p>I appreciated that Yvone set up the database in AWS and Yusuf set up the API functions from GCP, which provided the team an environment to initiate our development. Once the environment was set up, we could finally investigate the workload in detail. For instance, how to achieve each proposed feature, how the interface should look like, and what the expected behavior corresponds to each function. We realized the workload was huge, which required each member to spend a big amount of time developing each part.</p>
									<p>We were facing another problem, that some bugs occurred during development, which means more time was required to fix those issues while our workloads were already overloaded. Thanks to our teamwork, each member was willing to investigate each raised bug and solve them with their experience. Our project could never be completed in time without the support and collaboration of our amazing team.</p>
