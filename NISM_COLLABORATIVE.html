                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>In the article, it has been proved that it is possible to breach the medical training mannequin, iStan. And it also indicates that it does not require complicated attack techniques to breach iStan. The article reveals the fact that the medical training mannequins are at risk of the attack.</p>
                  <p>As iStan is possible to be attacked in the production environment, it means the accuracy of the data related to the training and other medical purposes are at risk. Once the data of iStan cannot be secured, the incorrect raw data collected from the mannequins can have a negative impact on the medical research, which can be a significant threat.  'Cyberattacks, or breaches of information security, appear to be increasing in frequency, and few are willing to ignore the possibility that the severity of future attacks could be much greater than what has been observed to date.' (Brian C. et al., 2004)</p>
                  <p>'The security solution was breached using an open source brute force attack against the router Personal Identification Number (PIN).' (Glisson A, 2015) The security can be compromised by the implemented Backtrack 5. Without a stronger security defense, this defect is considered to be the vulnerability that expose the iStan in danger.</p>
                  <p>Although the medical training tool might not be a popular target, the damage and cost can be extremely large once it is compromised. It is important to enhance and optimize the security system to lower the risk of breach. Providing network security training for the student in the College of Nursing can also decrease the possibility of iStan being attacked.</p>

                  <h2>Post by Kei Yiu Yvone Chan</h2>
                  <p>According to the Verizon Protected Health Information Data Breach Report (PHIDBR), the healthcare industry seems to be failing to catch up with the cybersecurity measures. It pointed out that basic security measures are still not being implemented in healthcare industry. Lost and stolen laptops with unencrypted PHI continue to be the cause of breach notifications. Besides, 58% of incidents involved insiders, which is highest among all the industries.</p>
                  <p>Under this situation, cybersecurity training may be beneficial for healthcare practitioners.   Beuran et al (2016) have suggested a few points that can increase the effectiveness of the training:</p>
									<div class="row">
										<ul>
											<li>The training content should be appropriate for the target audience in terms of knowledge and ability levels</li>
											<li>The training should use hands-on activities to develop practical abilities</li>
											<li>The training should be sustainable in a cost/performance perspective</li>
										</ul>
